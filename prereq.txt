Hi all!
To run this project, we need to have the following pre-reqs:

--> Step 1: Installation of NODE
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc
source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
sudo yum install nodejs 

--> Step 2: Check the versions
npm --version
node --version

--> Step 3: Install next globally and locally
npm install -g next
Navigate to your local repo: check where have you cloned your project
example: cd /home/ec2-user/<project-name>
npm install next

--> Step 4: Audit your dependencies/fix bugs
npm audit
npm audit fix --force (for finxing things forcefully)

--> Step 5: Build and start the project
npm run build && npm run start

NOTE: check for the port number on which we can access the project.

Happy Hosting!
